First creating an empty repository into your GitHub account.

Now we need to install git into our device . Then we have to select a directory where we want to clone our remote repository .

Now open cmd terminal and go into the desired directory . Then run the below command to clone the remote repo :
"git clone <URL>" 
Here url means the remote repo url .

Now run ls/dir command to see the files or directory after cloning , you will see there a directory with the same name as the remote repository.

#Create a txt file or any kind of other file . 

#Run "git status" command in your cmd terminal .

#Now to add the file run "git add <fileName> " command 

#Again run "git status" command , it will help you to guide the next command 

#To keep track of the changes you made to file easily we need to commit our changes and a messeage with it 
so that we can easily understand what changes we have commited 
run "git commit -m "Message" "

#Now if we refresh our remote repo we see nothing as the changes we've commited that is in our local repo,
not pushed it into the remote repo , to do so run the below command :
"git push "

If we refresh our remote repo now , we see the file we created locally is in your GitHub repository.

##If you face any issue with pushing your changes into the remote repo like upstream is not set up , run the below two commands :
"git branch --unset-upstream"
"git push --set-upstream origin master"
